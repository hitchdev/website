title: Goodhart's Tests
---

Goodhart's tests are tests which are written for the purpose of increasing test coverage. They are named as such after goodhart's law:

"A measure that becomes a target ceases to be a good measure"

Once code coverage percentage becomes an aim, the temptation to write [mimetic tests] and [paper thin tests] often grows uncontrollably.
