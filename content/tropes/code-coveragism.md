title: Code coveragism
---

Code coveragism is a form of [goodharting] whereby if higher code coverage is treated as the most important or even the only test quality target it becomes a bad measure.

Code coveragism will often cause poor quality tests to be written, [reflective tests], [tightly coupled tests] as well as tests covering [zombie code].

Pushing for code coverage is the act of intentionally ramping up code coverage to anywhere between 60-100% in an attempt to ensure a better tested system.

*Fanatical* code coveragism is the attempt to reach 100%.





Code coverage is a signal that code is *run* but not that it is necessarily run in a realistic environment.
